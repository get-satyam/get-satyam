### Hi there, I'm Satyam! 👋🍓 🍫

I am an undergrad pursuing my Bachelors in technology. I have a strong affinity for stock market and it's fundamentals.
I have the ability to make quick decisions, use prioritization skills, and to concentrate on detailed information. I can apply these skills to new transactions and scenarios.

Apart from technical analysis I try my hand at web development. I also enjoy doing competetive programming. I look forward to use my technical skills and apply them in the real world model.
